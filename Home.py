    This application helps you collect a dataset of hand signs, train a machine learning model, 
    and predict sign language gestures.
    To get started, navigate to the "Dataset Collector" page to capture hand sign images for your dataset.
    After collecting a sufficient number of images, move on to the "Model Training" page to train a model.
    Once the model is trained, you can use the "Sign Prediction" page to predict hand signs. """)
